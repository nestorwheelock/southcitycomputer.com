### Melissa Troemel - 27 Apr 2022 - 5 stars
"South City went above and beyond. I work online and rely on my laptop daily. Nestor fixed all issues on a rush basis and I didn't lose any working hours. He's extremely knowledgeable and patient with luddites, too. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!"

### Alice Prince - 27 Oct 2022 - 5 stars
"They are the best! I have never worked with a better computer tech company. This company diagnose my issue and fixed it. It was complicated but he solved my problem. I am a small business. Nestor is officially our new IT department. He went above and beyond the call of duty. He worked after hours to ensure I was up and running."

### Kevin Nestor - 20 Mar 2021 - 5 stars
"The staff here is super helpful, thoughtful and great to work with! The owner of this shop does a lot of the repairs himself and does quality work! He was able to not only help me regain access to the data on a laptop drive I was told was corrupted by another, more well known computer repair store. He was able to get the water damaged laptop up and running again!"

### Mario Orduna - 23 Nov 2019 - 5 stars
"These guys always find the way to get you going, it may take some time some times, but they help you, our computer was completely disable, still they saved the important info and even borrowed an old computer to complete the presentation that was due that day, they saved the day"

### Jack Pendleton - 29 Jul 2021 - 5 stars
"Great service, quick, complete. Katrina is a saint as she walked me thru the process to make transferred files accessible. Recommend to anyone needing top notch, professional computer service"

### Christina Hadfield - 30 Apr 2019 - 5 stars
"Absolutely amazing experience! I utterly panicked when my laptop would no longer turn on, right in the middle of finals week, and I didn't know what I was going to do. I found them through a google search and decided to give it a go. It was a pretty surreal experience when I showed up at the shop--I guess I went during non-walk in hours? But I kind of felt like I was in a cool spy movie, making contact via phone, following a set of instructions for sign in, and then dropping off my laptop like a top secret package. I put my full trust in these guys as a stressed out college student, and they absolutely delivered! They had my laptop fixed and ready for pick up in less than 24 hours (it was actually like 5 hours, I counted), and I didn't miss out on a single bit of studying! The staff was super friendly, very knowledgeable, and helpful, and after-hour pick up is super nice, especially for us busy college students. I've already told all my friends about my wacky adventure to their cool computer repair shop, and my friends were joking about breaking their laptops just so they could come for a visit! The way they handle customer service is awesome too (reading responses to reviews online here has given my friends and I LIFE). And I was very pleasantly surprised to find an extra discount on my bill for LGBT+ and Family. How neat is that!? Anyway, absolutely amazing experience, definitely will always return here for any of my tech needs. Thanks guys!"

### Howard Krohn - 9 Apr 2019 - 5 stars
"These guys really know what they're doing! They are extremely knowledgeable and have a delightfully quirky space that is fun to visit. Their support ticket system is easy to use and keeps you updated. Definitely worth coming here for your computer woes."

### Michael Davis - 10 May 2022 - 5 stars
"Took in my wife's computer that was running really slow and freezing up. South City tested the computer, backed up all the files, installed a new hard drive and re-installed the files quickly and at a great price. Will definitely use again if computer repairs are needed."

### Jane Steinhauer - 4 Dec 2019 - 5 stars
"Great service...reasonable prices...they took my old laptop and rebuilt the unit into a solid state..installed Linux..installed some new programs... best place to go"

### Berkeley Souza - 21 Jun 2022 - 5 stars
"South City Computer site had an easy to use ticket system, he got back to me quickly, was flexible in scheduling and definitely showed concern for transparency as he made a point to walk me through each step to make sure i understood what was happening. Will use again, for sure."

### Todd Evans - 21 Aug 2021 - 5 stars
"My daughter damaged the screen to her laptop. It needed a new one. They repaired it like it was brand new. It took a while for the part to come in - COVID, but once the part arrived the repair was made that day and I picked it up the next. The charge for service seemed very reasonable."

### Jenni Richards, RN - 10 Dec 2021 - 5 stars
"Excellent work. Have used them before, even buying a refurbished computer from them several years ago. The only place I would consider taking my computer. Would not hesitate to recommend them."
